#bubble sort

What is a bubble sort?
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly comparing two adjacent numbers and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

Time Complexities:
Best Case - O(n)
Average Case - O(n^2)
Worst Case - O(n^2)

This is a visual representation of how a modified bubble sort algorithm would work.
